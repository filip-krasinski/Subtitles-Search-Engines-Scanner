# What does it do?
SSES calculates hash of your video file then proceeds to scan public subtitles search engines in order to find the best match for your movie. The demo app can be seen [here](http://34.107.4.180/) although it should probably be hosted locally.

## Currently supported subtitles search engines:
- [opensubtitles.org](https://www.opensubtitles.org/)
- [napiprojekt.pl](https://www.napiprojekt.pl/)
- [napisy24.pl](https://napisy24.pl/)
